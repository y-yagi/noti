Trigger notifications when a process completes.

Never sit and wait for some long-running process to finish! `noti` will alert
you when it's done—on your computer or smartphone—so you can stop worrying about
constantly checking the terminal.

* Banner

### Environment

You can further configure `noti` by setting the following environment variables.

optionally change the default behavior, like setting `NOTI_VOICE` to change the
voice used in speech notifications.

```

    example, set NOTI_DEFAULT="banner speech pushbullet slack" to enable
    all available notifications to fire sequentially.

## Examples

Display a notification when `tar` finishes compressing files.

```
noti tar -cjf music.tar.bz2 Music/
```

You can also add `noti` after a command, in case you forgot at the beginning.

```
clang foo.c -Wall -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -o bizz; noti
```

If you already started a command, but forgot to use `noti`, then you can do this
to get notified when that process' PID disappears.

```
noti -pwatch $(pgrep docker-machine)
```
